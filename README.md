# Yorc HEAppE plugin

The Yorc HEAppE plugin implements a Ystia orchestrator plugin as described in [Yorc documentation](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html).
It allows the orchestrator to use HEappE (([High-End Application Execution](http://heappe.eu)) API to manage jobs executions on HPC infrastructures.
