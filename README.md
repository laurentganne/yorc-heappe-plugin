# Yorc HEAppE plugin

The Yorc HEAppE plugin implements a Yorc ([Ystia orchestrator](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/)) plugin as described in [Yorc documentation](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html), allowing the orchestrator to use the HEappE (([High-End Application Execution](http://heappe.eu)) API to manage jobs executions on HPC infrastructures.
